# Run the Learner Walkthrough

## When To Use
The course looked right in review and the first real learner got lost on screen three. Reviewers know the subject, so they read past the gaps a newcomer falls into. Use this on a draft, before release, to watch a few people from the role work through it and see where the draft loses them.

## When Not To Use
For a desk check of facts, alignment and accessibility against sources, use Check the AI Draft, and run it first. For a full run of the programme with a group and a pass line, use Plan the Pilot. The walkthrough is one person at a time on a draft: earlier, smaller and cheaper.

## Inputs
- The draft (storyboard, prototype, built module or job aid) and the role it is for.
- The objectives and the sections you are least sure about; after the sessions, your observation notes, with no names in them.
If you have none of this, I start from the draft and the role, and mark the output as a first draft.

## Approach
The method is thinking aloud testing, a usability method described on a public practitioner page: recruit representative users, give them representative tasks, and stay quiet while they talk. Here it is applied to a draft course. It tests the draft, never the learner. I prepare the plan and sort your notes; you sit beside the person. The failure this prevents: the designer walks a colleague through the module, explains each unclear screen as they go, and leaves convinced it works.

## Workflow
1. Ask at most three questions: which draft and sections, how many volunteers you can sit with ([number]), and the severity scale you use (for example blocks the learner, slows them, cosmetic).
2. Plan who: a handful of volunteers who do the role, not reviewers and not experts. Write the invitation they get in writing: the draft is being tested, not you; nothing about you is kept; you can stop at any time.
3. Write the tasks, representative and free of hints: "work through section [n] as you would at your desk", "answer this check", "find what to do when [case]". A task that names the button gives the answer away. Add the prompts that keep people talking without leading: "keep talking", "what are you looking for?", "what do you expect to happen?". The observer does not explain, help or defend the draft; note the urge and the screen instead.
4. Prepare the observation sheet about the DRAFT: screen or page, what happened (hesitated, misread, guessed, skipped, gave up), what was said, no names. No recording of a person's performance, and nothing goes to their manager.
5. When you paste your notes, I sort them into an issue list: one row per issue, the number of sessions it appeared in, severity on your scale, a proposed fix, an owner. An issue seen once and blocking still ranks above a cosmetic one seen every time.
6. State the limit, then set up the call: talking while learning adds load, so this shows where the draft confuses, not how much people learn. Release, fix first, or walk through again.

## Output Format
```markdown
# Learner Walkthrough Plan and Findings
Draft: [name, version] | Volunteers: [number] people who do [role], no reviewers, no experts | Observer: [name]
Limit: this shows where the draft confuses people, not how much they learn.
## What volunteers are told, and the prompts
Told in writing: the draft is being tested, not you; nothing about you is kept; you can stop at any time.
Prompts: "keep talking" / "what are you looking for?" / "what do you expect to happen?"
## Tasks
| Task (no hints) | Section | What it should show |
|---|---|---|
| [task] | [section] | [question about the draft] |
## Observation sheet (about the draft, no names)
| Session | Screen or page | What happened | What was said |
|---|---|---|---|
| [n] | [screen] | [hesitated, misread, guessed, skipped, gave up] | [words used] |
## Issue list
| Issue | Screen | Sessions it appeared in | Severity ([your scale]) | Proposed fix | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [issue] | [screen] | [n of n] | [level] | [fix] | [name] |
## Fix list
| Fix | Owner | By | Walk through again |
|---|---|---|---|
| [fix] | [name] | [date] | [yes or no] |
## Decision
[Designer name] makes the call by [date]: release, fix first, or walk through again.
```

## Done When
- Every volunteer does the role and has had the written note before the session.
- No task wording contains a hint, and the observation sheet and issue list name screens, never people.
- Every issue has a severity on your scale, a fix and an owner, and the call is made by a named person.

## Quality Bar
- Counts of sessions are the ones you observed; nothing is turned into a percentage or a finding about learners in general.
- A screen where the observer wanted to step in is itself logged as an issue.
- A volunteer who struggles is evidence about the draft, and the notes say so in those terms.
- Claude prepares the plan and sorts your notes; you sit beside the learner, the session tests the course and never the person, and the designer makes the release call.

Run ldg-plan-the-session (Plan the Session) when the programme also runs live.
