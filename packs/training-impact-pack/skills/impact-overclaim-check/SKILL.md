name: impact-overclaim-check
description: Checks a draft training report claim by claim before it is sent, producing a numbered list of every claim with the checks it fails, its strength and a verdict, a rewrite for each weak claim and a list of what must come out. Use for "run impact-overclaim-check", "check my training report before I send it", "am I overclaiming", "can I say the training caused this", "review my impact report", "fact check L&D report", "is this claim supported", "sanity check training results", part of the Claude Guide for Training Impact Pack by Polar Bear.

# Overclaim Check

## When To Use
The report reads well and you are about to send it. Use this on any finished draft (a one-pager, a quarterly page, a briefing, an email with results in it) when the question is which sentences would not survive a reader from finance asking "how do you know?".

## When Not To Use
Not for building the argument: Training Contribution Analysis works out what the evidence can support, and Before-and-After Results Table computes the figures. This check only tests how a finished draft describes them. A draft with no figures and no claims does not need it.

## Inputs
- The draft, pasted in full, with who will read it and when it goes.
- The evidence behind it: the results table, the agreement, the reasoning about other explanations. Group figures only.
- The minimum reporting group, and how many data points you require before you will call something a trend.
If you have none of this beyond the draft, I start from the draft alone, mark every claim whose evidence I have not seen as "evidence not seen", and mark the output as a first draft.

## Approach
The tests come from "Communicating quality, uncertainty and change", guidance from the UK Government Analysis Function: say "estimate" where it is one, give absolute and relative change together, warn when numbers are too low for a trend, replace vague cautions with what can and cannot be concluded. Each claim then gets one of this guide's three strengths: shown, suggested or unknown. The failure this prevents is one sentence, "the programme drove the improvement", read aloud by someone who knows a new tool went live the same month; after that, nobody trusts the careful pages either. A second reader paid to doubt is cheaper before sending than after.

## Workflow
1. I ask three questions at once: who reads this draft and when it goes; which evidence files you are pasting with it; and the minimum reporting group and the fewest points you accept for a trend (you set both).
2. List every claim, numbered, in the draft's own words with where it sits: any sentence that asserts a result, a cause, a comparison or a trend. Headlines, slide titles and chart captions count; they are where claims grow.
3. Test each claim against eight checks: (A) a causal verb (caused, led to, drove, thanks to, resulted in) with no isolation method named; (B) a percentage on a small group or with no group size; (C) a missing denominator; (D) a relative change with no absolute change; (E) a benchmark, an average or a quote with no source; (F) a figure with no voucher; (G) a trend from too few points; (H) "typical" drawn from chosen cases.
4. Give each claim its strength and a verdict. Shown: a before and an after from a named source, a comparison or another named isolation method, and a voucher. Suggested: a change that fits the chain but with no comparison, other explanations open, or people's own reports only. Unknown: no data, a group under the minimum, or no baseline. Verdict: keep, rewrite or remove.
5. Rewrite each weak claim with the word that matches its strength: "the figures show", "the evidence suggests", "we do not know whether". A rewrite makes a claim smaller or more exact; it never borrows strength from a neighbouring sentence.
6. Replace vague cautions ("results should be read with care") with what the reader can and cannot conclude. Flag any sentence that turns evidence about the programme into a statement about a person or a named team: those are removed, not reworded.
7. Close with the list of what must come out before sending, and what evidence would let a removed claim back in. The check adds no claim, figure or source of its own.

## Output Format
```markdown
# Overclaim Check
Draft checked: [title, version] · Reader: [role] · Goes on: [date] · Evidence seen: [files / none] · Evidence not seen, and who holds it: [list] · Minimum reporting group: [you set] · Fewest points for a trend: [you set]
## Claims
| # | Claim as written | Where | Checks failed (A to H) | Strength | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [sentence from the draft] | [page, slide or line] | [letters / none] | [shown / suggested / unknown / evidence not seen] | [keep / rewrite / remove] |
## Rewrites
| # | As written | Rewritten | What would let the stronger wording back in |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#] | [sentence] | [sentence at its true strength] | [evidence, and who could get it] |
## Vague cautions replaced
| As written | What the reader can conclude | What the reader cannot |
|---|---|---|
| [caution] | [statement] | [statement] |
## Must come out before sending
| # | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| [#] | [claim, figure, benchmark or quote] | [no source / no voucher / group under the minimum / about a person] |
## Decision
[Name, role] accepts or overrules each verdict and sends the report by [date]; any claim kept against a "remove" verdict carries [name]'s initials and the reason.
```

## Done When
- Every result, cause, comparison and trend in the draft is on the numbered list, titles and captions included.
- Each claim has the checks it failed, a strength and a verdict.
- Every "rewrite" has a new sentence, and every "remove" is on the final list with its reason.
- No sentence in the output says more than the sentence it replaces.

## Quality Bar
- The draft's own words are quoted exactly; a claim is never paraphrased into something easier to defend.
- "Evidence not seen" is a verdict of its own. I do not assume a figure is sound because it looks plausible.
- Thresholds are yours: the minimum group and the points for a trend are never supplied.
- The check removes claims and never adds one; whatever survives has a source, a voucher and a strength, and a named person sends the report.
